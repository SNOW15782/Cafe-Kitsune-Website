    <h2>The Art of Coffee By Cafe Kitsune</h2>
    <p>The concept behind Cafe Kitsune is to create and operate a space that marries the simplistic beauty of the small and intimate coffee bars with the style and cool of everything that Cafe Kitsuné undertakes. Cafe Kitsune pays tribute to the pleasure of enjoying a quality coffee in locations that are both modern, cosmopolitan and welcoming.
        The coffee served at the Café Kitsuné is full-bodied and flavoursome, with notes of chocolate and grilled hazelnuts, and a texture that is both smooth and syrupy.</p>

    <p>For those who can’t live without it, the Café Kitsuné coffee beans are available to buy in packets of 100g, 250g and 1kg… an ideal gift for friends or oneself!</p>

    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Cafe Kitsune was born out of a passion for sharing amazing coffee, and this passion continues to drive us today. Every day we make small and deliberate choice to build and develop the quality of our cooffees, our cafes, and our partnetships. We've been focused on creating beautiful coffee experiences and connecting people.</p>
